# Small projects with Elegant code base
We have been seeing such questions in Rust forums for a long time: 

- What projects would you recommend to a Rust beginner?
- Looking for small projects with an elegant code base
- Codes that is easy to read and learn

So, collecting relative resourses and representing in _Rust By Practice_ seems not a bad idea.

Answers for above questions usually came with [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), though I don't think it is a **small** project, but yes, go for it if you are not afraid to delve deep a bit.

[Ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot), a terminal spotify client. Small, simple, well organized and async, it's good for learning.
