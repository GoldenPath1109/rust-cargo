# Rust exercise
> 中文 Readme [传送门](./zh-CN/Readme.md)。

Greetings and welcome to `exercise.rs`， I don't know whether you had the following problems before you were here，but I do (in early days): 

- After learning some rust knowledge, you want to take a step:  do some exercises, but found unchallenging ones
- Found nothing about rust toolchains, std, ascyn/.await topics
- Still have no idea of what to do next, maybe you tried writing a demo /project, but... failed or 

But now, you come here and everthing will change: here you can find bunch of easy to hard exercises to improve your Rust skills，this will help you fill the gap of easy-to-learn and hard-to-use.


## Online Reading
This book is written in English and Chinese, you can pick up the language you are familiar with:
- English: [https://exercise.rs](https://exercise.rs)
- 简体中文: [https://zh.exercise.rs](https://zh.exercise.rs)

## Learning Rust
If you are a first-time Rust learner, here are some high quality learning resources :
- [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html) for English  speakers
- [Rust语言圣经(The Course)](https://course.rs) for Chinese speakers, it covers nearly all the topics in Rust


## difference to rustlings
[Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) only contains small and easy exercises for junior rust devs. There is a big gap between learning Rust and using it in your projects.

Another limit for rustlings is that you have to download rustlings to local machine and compile it first before starting to learn.

## difference to rust by example
[Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/) is an excellent online book for learning Rust，`exercise.rs` has some small advantages in :

- more topics and exercises，specially for the hard part of Rust，e.g lifetime、smart pointers、threads 、async/.await etc
- difficulty from easy to hard，it will minimize the gap between learning and using in projects
- up-to-date, e.g features which added in Rust 1.58 also have the corresponding exercises in `exercise.rs`
- Both `course.rs` and `exercise.rs` are designed according to the CS courses in college，so quliaty is the most important factor
